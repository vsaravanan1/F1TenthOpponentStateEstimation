CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable PCL_ROOT is set to:

    /usr

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsensor_msgs_py.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "sensor_msgs_py", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sensor_msgs_py"
  with any of the following names:

    sensor_msgs_pyConfig.cmake
    sensor_msgs_py-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sensor_msgs_py" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sensor_msgs_py_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "sensor_msgs_py" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
